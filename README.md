6. There are 7 categories. If you don't know or understand anything from the other 6 categories, leave it just the way it is or Google the information so you'll get a better idea of it all. Click "Review + Create" and ensure that all the information is accurate, then click "Create" and wait a few minutes for your Virtual Machine to be created.
